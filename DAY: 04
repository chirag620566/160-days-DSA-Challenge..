// You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. You have to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed in place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.
// SOLUTION :

               class Solution {
  public:
    void pushZerosToEnd(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int index = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] != 0){
                arr[index++] = arr[i];
            }
        }
        
        while (index < n) {
            arr[index++] = 0;
        }
    
    }
};
